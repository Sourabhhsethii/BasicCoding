/**
 * All Paths from Source to Target Node
 * Description
 * Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of n nodes labelled from 0 to n - 1, count all possible paths from node 0 to node n - 1, and return the number of paths.
 *
 *
 *
 * The graph is given as follows: graph[i] is a list of all nodes you can visit from node i (i.e. , there is a directed edge from node i to node graph[i][j]).
 *
 *
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Input:
 *
 * If graph = [[1,2],[3],[3],[]], the input can be taken as follows:
 *
 *
 *
 * first line: (number of nodes) 4
 *
 * second line: (nodes you can visit from first node) 1 2
 *
 * third line: (nodes you can visit from second node) 3
 *
 * fourth line: (nodes you can visit from third node) 3
 *
 * fifth line:( nodes you can visit from fourth node) -1
 *
 *
 *
 * Note: input -1 implies no node can be visited from the given node.
 *
 *
 *
 * Output: 2
 *
 * Explanation: There are two paths: 0 -> 1 -> 3 and 0 -> 2 -> 3.
